# Welcome to Bug Wrangler Ranch

This first self-assessment is for you to hone several Core Skills that you need as a software developer.

Taking your time now to be thorough, reflective, patient and curious will give you the foundation to be successful throughout the rest of this course and your career.

If you rush this, or think of it as a test to be "passed", then you will already be on the wrong path.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Description

Slim Jenkins offers a vacation package for people who have always wanted to join a cattle driving team across the American Midwest.

He calls it the **Kansas Slim's Cattle Adventure**.

People join a team of experienced drovers who will train them in the basics of herding cattle and driving them across hundreds of miles to their destination at Old Red's Ranch.

Unfortunately, someone gained access to the code that produces an outline of the adventure to the paying customers, so Slim has hired you to examine and fix the code.

## Learning Objectives

Here are your learning objectives for this self-assessment.

1. Able to use the debugger to step through existing code to discover root causes of bugs.
2. Drawing a sequence diagram for a project.
   > Use the [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/) site to generate your sequence diagram. Make sure you save your work as you go.
3. Demonstrate learning efficiency by researching concepts you haven't seen before using your peers, mentors, and the World Wide Web as resources.
4. Awareness of when you need help, and then seeking it out.

## Example Output

If you are able to fix all of the bugs, you will output similar to what is below. It will not be identical, but similar.

You will be accompanying 5 drovers as they drive 50 cattle to Old Red's Ranch for grazing

The herd is made of up the following types of cattle:
Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,American Angus,Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,
Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,

Here is the team of drovers you will be joining
        * Melvyn Hethron
        * Yancy Gresley
        * Willabella Attarge
        * Ynes Gyenes
        * Farlie Spere


Your journey will take you through the wildness of the American Midwest and across the following terrain
        * forest
        * plain
        * river
        * mountain
```

1. In the **main** module, one of the first lines of code is `const drovers = hireDrovers(cattleToDrive)`. Explain what the value of the `drovers` variable is when that line of code runs.
   > // When the above line of code runs, the value of the `drovers` variable is set as `undefined` in the debugger's variables section. `drovers` has no value other then "undefined" until line 5 of drovers.js, when "database.drovers" is assigned to allDrovers.
2. At the bottom of the main module, you will see the following code - `for (const drover of drovers)`. Explain what the values of both the `drover` and the `drovers` variables are.
   > // Ideally the values of `drover` and `drovers` will be the local variable used to iterate through each element of the drovers array, and the actual array of drovers respectively. In the debugger, one can see that as the line is executed, drover is `undefined` and `drovers` has the 0-4 index positions full of random drovers from the list. on line 32 of main.js, the drover element is defined with the id of the "0th" -- or first -- element in the drovers index.
3. In the **journey** module, there is a `journeyMaker()` function. In that function, there is a variable named `areas` which will have the value of an object. Use your debugger to show what the value of each key is on that object. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com) to record your session.
   > Your public Loom URL here: https://www.loom.com/share/c8d1c02c85b74c9fa13436ea7ed6a4ce
4. Also in the **journey** module, there is the following code:
   ```js
   for (let forestNumber = 0; forestNumber < areas.forests; forestNumber++) {
      journey.push("forest")
   }
   ```
   Explain this code with your best vocabulary.
   > // These lines of code are resposible for iterating through the set terrain of forests. forestNumber is a local variable that is assigned to zero to indicate no forests in the journey until the forest property is assigned to the areas (as done in areas.forests). Then forestNumber++ adds to the number of forests shown in the debugger for each area type as the code progresses through each for loop of journeyMaker.
5. Explain the value of the `database` variable in the **database** module. Be as comprehensive as possible.
   > // the `database` variable is what the indexes of cattleTypes and drovers are assigned to. Later on in the cattle.js and drovers.js files, the database variable is called with dot notation to transfer the section of the database needed (whether it's drovers or cattleTypes) into the methods of the aforementioned modules that produce the final lists funneled back into main.js.
6. In the **drovers** module, there is a `hireDrovers()` function. You will notice the following code on that line - `(herdSize)`. What is that defining, and where does it get its value?
   > // The `(herdSize)` parameter is passed into the `hireDrovers()` function to use in comparison with the final cattle[] array to make sure that the number of drovers passed on to main.js is one tenth of the number of cattle rounded up (because the number of drovers must remain an integer and not a float). This means that the `(herdSize)` parameter's value is the number of animals pushed to the cattle[] array by the `hireDrovers()` function.

## When You Are Done

After you have answered all the questions above, you need to push all of your code back up to Github. Follow these instructions.

1. Be in the `bug-wrangler-ranch` directory.
2. `git add --all`
3. `git commit -m "Code complete"`
4. `git push origin main`

Then go to the Learning Platform and click the **Self-assessment Complete** button.
